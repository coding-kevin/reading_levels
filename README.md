# Reading Levels

This app calculates the reading grade level of the provided text. Accuracy depends on the [Coleman-Liau Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemanâ€“Liau_index) it is based on. 

The basic idea is to count the number and length of words per sentence.

## Background

This app was originally written from scratch in C for CS50. It was then rewritten in Python and is now in JavaScript. 

I used the idea to learn basic JS concepts, forms, Regex, etc.
